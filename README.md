d. Create 3 new Student objects based on input
e. Add 2 new Courses to a Faculty object
f. Add 2 new Courses to a Student object
g. Add an array of 2 Courses to a Faculty object
h. Add an array of 2 Courses to a Student object
i. Get the Course at index (valid and invalid indexes) from a Faculty object
j. Get the Course at index (valid and invalid indexes) from a Student object
k. Allow the user to select a Faculty object and a Course object from menus and query the Faculty object for the Course to determine whether the Faculty object teaches it or not.
l. Determine which Faculty object teaches the most and the least courses.
m. Determine which Course is the minimum of all Course objects in the catalog.
n. Determine which Course is the maximum of all Course objects in the catalog.
o. Determine which Student has the most and least credits.
