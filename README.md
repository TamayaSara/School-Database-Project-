<h2>OBJECTIVES:</h2>
<p>1. Course class completed as per UML and passes zybook test cases</p>
<p>2. Person class completed as per UML and passes zybook test cases</p>
<p>3. Employee class completed as per UML and passes zybook test cases</p>
<p>4. GeneralStaff class completed as per UML and passes zybook test cases</p>
<p>5. Faculty class completed as per UML and passes zybook test cases</p>
<p>6. Student class completed as per UML and passes zybook test cases</p>
<p>7. Fields of all classes completed as per UML and confirmed via zybook test cases</p>
<p>8. Read from file (the path and filename should be “SchoolDB_Initial.txt”)</p>
<p>9. Display the plain text file content on the console</p>
<p>10. Create the Objects as specified from the file content</p>
<p>11. Using the toString() method of each object, display all the objects to the console in the following order (See sample output below):</p>
<p>   - All Course objects</p>
<p>    - All Person objects</p>
<p>    - All Employee objects</p>
<p>   - All GeneralStaff objects</p>
<p>   - All Faculty objects</p>
<p>   - All Student objects</p>
<p>12. Create a menu that will interact with the user and do the following:</p>
<p>a. Create 3 new Course objects based on input</p>
<p>b. Create 3 new Faculty objects based on input</p>
<p>c. Create 3 new GeneralStaff objects based on input</p>
<p>d. Create 3 new Student objects based on input</p>
<p>e. Add 2 new Courses to a Faculty object</p>
<p>f. Add 2 new Courses to a Student object</p>
<p>g. Add an array of 2 Courses to a Faculty object</p>
<p>h. Add an array of 2 Courses to a Student object</p>
<p>i. Get the Course at index (valid and invalid indexes) from a Faculty object</p>
<p>j. Get the Course at index (valid and invalid indexes) from a Student object</p>
<p>k. Allow the user to select a Faculty object and a Course object from menus and query the Faculty object for the Course to determine whether the Faculty object teaches it or not.</p>
<p>l. Determine which Faculty object teaches the most and the least courses</p>
<p>m. Determine which Course is the minimum of all Course objects in the catalog</p>
<p>n. Determine which Course is the maximum of all Course objects in the catalog</p>
<p>o. Determine which Student has the most and least credits</p>
<p>14. Display all the Objects using toString on the console (this includes existing plus recently added)</p>
<p>15. Write all of the Object details to a plain text output file using the same format as the input file</p>
